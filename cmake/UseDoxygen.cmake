# - Run Doxygen
#
# Adds a doxygen target that runs doxygen to generate the html
# and optionally the LaTeX API documentation.
# The doxygen target is added to the doc target as dependency.
# i.e.: the API documentation is built with:
#  make doc
#
# USAGE: GLOBAL INSTALL
#
# Install it with:
#  cmake ./ && sudo make install
# Add the following to the CMakeLists.txt of your project:
#  include(UseDoxygen OPTIONAL)
# Optionally copy Doxyfile.in in the directory of CMakeLists.txt and edit it.
#
# USAGE: INCLUDE IN PROJECT
#
#  set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
#  include(UseDoxygen)
# Add the Doxyfile.in and UseDoxygen.cmake files to the projects source directory.
#
#
# Variables you may define are:
#  DOXYFILE_OUTPUT_DIR - Path where the Doxygen output is stored. Defaults to "doc".
#
#  DOXYFILE_LATEX_DIR - Directory where the Doxygen LaTeX output is stored. Defaults to "latex".
#
#  DOXYFILE_HTML_DIR - Directory where the Doxygen html output is stored. Defaults to "html".
