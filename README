dune-grid-multiscale is a DUNE (http://www.dune-project.org) module which
provides localized views of a given host grid. This is often required in the
context of multiscale simulations.

New users may best try out this module by using the git supermodule
dune-grid-multiscale-demos
(http://users.dune-project.org/projects/dune-grid-multiscale-demos).
Experienced DUNE users may go ahead. As usual, you will have to call autogen,
configure and make using dunecontrol (see
http://www.dune-project.org/doc/installation-notes.html), working examples
are located in 'examples/'...
